# File System Service

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

Welcome to my File System Service project!

### About This Project

This project is my hands-on lab for learning and mastering a variety of modern backend technologies, including:

-   **Java & Spring Boot:** Building a robust REST API.
-   **Spring Data JPA:** Interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
-   **AWS S3:** For scalable, cloud-based file storage.
-   **Spring Security:** Implementing JWT-based authentication and authorization.
-   **Docker:** Containerizing the application for consistent development and deployment.
-   **CI/CD Principles:** Setting up a pipeline for automated builds and testing. (Maybe)

As I learn, I'll be implementing new features and refactoring existing code. The primary goal is education and practical experience, so you'll see the project evolve over time.

## API Docs
